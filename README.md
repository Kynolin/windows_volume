This is my attempt to make an easier way to set the Windows volume for all apps to match the master volume level.

When some apps, like Discord, frequently attenuate the volume of other apps, the volume level of other apps doesn't always return to the original value. A common example is to trigger attenuation while using a push to talk (PTT) button, or when other people talk. After a while, some apps may have their volume level severely reduced below the master volume level. With a Python script, all apps can be brought back to match the master volume level. This can be set as a shortcut as an easy way to fix the volume levels quickly.
